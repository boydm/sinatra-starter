Simple hello world starter app that combines...

__sinatra, pry, jquery, sprockets, compass, bootstrap-sass, markdown, partials, content_for, more...__

It starts out with working images, css and js. The JQuery and Bootstrap js are downloaded from the Cloudflare cdn and the local js is compiled through sprockets.

Simply clone this repository, and bundle install.

For developement, i'm using shotgun, so start the server with:

shotgun config.ru
